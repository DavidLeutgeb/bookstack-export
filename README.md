# bookstack-export
Python Script for making HTML backups of all books in a Bookstack (https://www.bookstackapp.com) installation. Bookstack is an amazing wiki software, I am NOT the creator, just a user enjoying using it. 
I use this script for making a backup every day from all my bookstack books, just for having a offline backup in case the instance is not available.

The script uses the Bookstack REST API and creates a folder for every day, if the folder already exists the script quits.
